# ReVamp - a mildly controversial architecture pattern for supercharged web apps 🚀

This repository serves as an opinionated starting point for building modern web applications. It is not a complete, production-ready app but rather a template showcasing a specific architecture pattern using a comprehensive suite of tools. Many decisions are based on Josh Comeau's excellent course [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

## Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, type-safe, and performant tech stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **State Management**:
  - [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for global state.
  - [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for remote data fetching and caching.
- **Authentication**: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- **Forms**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for validation.
- **Testing**:
  - **Unit/Integration**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
  - **End-to-End**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
- **Linting & Formatting**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Example Implementations

This project includes comprehensive boilerplate and examples for key libraries:

### 🔄 SWR Data Fetching

Complete implementation with examples covering:

- **Basic fetching** with loading/error states
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **CRUD operations** using mutations
- **Real-time search** with debouncing
- **Authenticated requests** with token handling

**Location**: `lib/swr/` and `components/examples/`

**Demo Page**: Visit `/swr-demo` to see all examples in action

**Documentation**:

- Quick reference: `lib/swr/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

### 🔐 Authentication (NextAuth.js)

Complete auth setup with session management and protected routes.

**Location**: `lib/auth/` and `app/api/auth/`

### 📦 Redux State Management

Redux Toolkit implementation with example slices.

**Location**: `lib/redux/`
